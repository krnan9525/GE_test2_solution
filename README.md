Bees have stage machine attached containing following stages:
public enum State {Wander, Approach, Arrive, Gather, Return};

Pretty self-explanatory.

Difference between Approach and Arrive is:
Approach: approach to the randomly generated position.
Arrive: arrive at the 'folower'

Only one 'bee' will attach to one single 'folwer' at a time.
